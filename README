camtickler: Utility for working with IP camera firmware

This utility allows you to retrieve and replace firmware for supported models
of network-connected video cameras.

It can connect to the camera over the network and also over a serial port/UART
if needed.

Features:

  * Copy firmware from camera.  This is very useful to restore the camera to
    its original state in case a later flash goes bad.

  * Automatic identification of supported devices.  Some devices require a
    serial connection (e.g. with a USB to TTL serial adapter) for full
    functionality.

  * Device detail.  Flash size, USB IDs, etc.  This will eventually be used to
    identify firmware compatible with the device.

Supported devices are:

  * MayGion MIPS
